= Privacy Features =

The German computer magazine c’t has developed “Shariff” (ʃɛɹɪf) that follows the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR – Regulation (EU) 2016/679). This plugin adapts the Shariff concept.
 
The "original" share buttons from Facebook, Pinterest and others automatically transmit data of your visitors to the social network sites as soon as they visit your website. They do not need to click on a share button for this to happen and therefore have no choice. Shareaholic enables visitors to see how popular your page is and display share buttons without this needless leakage to the social networks (unless they decide to share, of course). This is done via server-side code that is part of this plugin to fetch share counts. Once fetched, share counts are cached to ensure maximum performance.

To take advantage of this privacy feature, enable "Share Count Proxy" under Advanced Settings.

= Share Buttons for Images =

* Automatically add Pinterest’s “Pin It” button and other social share buttons directly onto the images on your site to increase outbound traffic to your social sites, and inbound traffic to your website. 
* Includes integrated share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and more!

[Share Buttons for Images](https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/) demo

= Floating Share Buttons =

* Increase social sharing by 2x or more by adding our Share Button plugin that hovers on the side of the page, rather than in the page content.

[Floating Share Buttons](https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/) demo

6. I love that Related Content is already included in the Shareaholic WordPress plugin because it keeps my blog uncluttered and my page load time to a minimum.
7. Since installing Related Content, I’ve loved seeing more traffic on my older posts.
8. Because I produce a ton of content every day, I rely on Related Content to pull posts for my readers that they wouldn’t find on their own. 

== Installation ==

*In WordPress:*

1. Go to Plugins -> Add New -> Search for `Shareaholic`
2. Press "Install Now" for the `Shareaholic` plugin
3. Press "Activate Plugin"
4. Adjust settings to your liking
5. If you use a caching plugin please clear the cache
6. Enjoy!

*Manual installation:*

1. Upload the extracted `shareaholic` directory to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Open the plugin settings page Settings -> Shareaholic
4. Adjust settings to your liking
5. If you use a caching plugin please clear the cache
6. Enjoy!

*WP-CLI installation:*

1. `wp plugin install shareaholic --activate`

= Shareaholic Shortcode Support / Manual Usage =

You can place Share Buttons, Related Content and any other Shareaholic apps manually wherever you're like in your theme. Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="total_share_count"]`

Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If you prefer, you can also use the `App Name` instead of the `App ID`. This can be very useful for multi-site installations and theme developers who would like to bundle Shareaholic. For example:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id_name="post_below_content"]`

If both `id` and `id_name` are defined, `id` will take priority.

In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:

`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="Insert Shareaholic App ID here"]'); ?>`

Note: optionally, you can specify `title`, `link` or `summary` as Shareaholic shortcode parameters. If you don't specify these optional parameters, the shortcode will automatically determine these values.

Example:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>" title="About Me" link="https://mysite.com/about" summary="This is me"]`

If use double quotes ("'s) in your title or summary, make sure to encode them properly as `&quot;`. Shareaholic Shortcode's are full featured and support all available configuration options available. Enjoy!

[General information about shortcodes and WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode)

= Share Count SDK =

For example - To display Facebook and Pinterest Share Counts:

<code>
<script>
(function(s,r){;s[r]=s[r]||function(){(s[r].q=s[r].q||[]).push(arguments)}})(window,'Shareaholic');

Shareaholic(
    'getShareCounts',
    { services: ['facebook', 'pinterest'] },
    (counts) => {
      document.querySelector('#shr-share-counts').innerText = counts.total;
    },
);
</script>

<div id="shr-share-counts">-</div>
</code>

Note: Facebook share counts are part of our premium Share Count service and [requires a paid plan](https://www.shareaholic.com/plan). Additional Share Count SDK code examples illustrated [here](https://www.shareaholic.com/sharecounter).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Shareaholic free? =

Yes! Shareaholic's core features are and always will be free.

= Should I purchase a paid plan? =

Shareaholic's paid services include Share Count Recovery, advanced analytics, premium customization settings, priority support, and more. To learn more, visit our [plan comparison page](https://www.shareaholic.com/plans).

= Do I need to have coding skills to use Shareaholic? =

Not at all. You can manage Shareaholic without any coding using our user-friendly drag and drop interface.

We combine the functionality of many -- social, content, and monetization plugins including: Contextual Related Posts (CRP), Social Warfare, Tasty Pins, Social Pug, Grow Social by Mediavine, Sassy Bookmarks, SexyBookmarks, Shariff, AddThis, AddToAny, and many others into one effecient and powerful package.

= Shareaholic is not displaying for me. Why, and what should I try? =

Something on your own personal device/browser/connection is likely filtering web functionality like major social buttons. The usual cause for this uncommon issue is 3rd party browser add-on software that blocks ads and optionally filters out major social buttons. For example, some security apps and Internet connections have an option to filter social buttons. Usually a social filter option is disabled by default, but if you find that some software is inappropriately filtering Shareaholic, please [let us know](https://www.shareaholic.com/contact).

= Where can I find a detailed FAQ? =

Please see here: [Shareaholic Helpdesk](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us)

= Where can I get detailed Usage & Installation instructions? =

Please see here: [Usage & Installation Instructions](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us/categories/200101476-WordPress-Plugin)

= Can I disable the redirect screen after activation? =

When Shareaholic is activated it redirects to its welcome screen. If you want to prevent this you can use the function below:

`
/**
 * Disable Shareaholic activation redirect
 *
 * Use this if you use the TGM Plugin Activation to install plugins
 */
function prefix_shareaholic_disable_welcome_redirect() {
	delete_transient( '_shr_activation_redirect' );
}
`

= Can I disable the Review Notice forever? =

If you want to prevent the Review Notice from appearing you can use the function below:

`
/**
 * Disable Shareaholic Review Notice
 *
 */
function shareaholic_disable_review_notice() {
  remove_action('admin_notices', array('ShareaholicAdmin', 'display_review_notice'));
}
add_action('admin_init', 'shareaholic_disable_review_notice', 11);
`

= How can I programmatically disable Shareaholic In-Page Apps? =

You can disable Shareaholic In-Page Apps using a [filter](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/) (PHP code) that you can add to a "functionality" plugin such as the [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin.

Disable Shareaholic In-Page Apps in specific categories, for example:

`function shareaholic_disable_categories() {
	// Examples of in_category usage: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/in_category
	if ( in_category( array( 'my_category_1_slug', 'my_category_2_slug' ) ) ) {
		return true;
	}
}
add_filter( 'shareaholic_disable_share_buttons', 'shareaholic_disable_categories' );
add_filter( 'shareaholic_disable_recommendations', 'shareaholic_disable_categories' );`

Disable Shareaholic In-Page Apps on a custom post type, for example:

`function shareaholic_disable_customposts() {
	if ( 'my_custom_post_type' == get_post_type() ) {
		return true;
	}
}
add_filter( 'shareaholic_disable_share_buttons', 'shareaholic_disable_customposts' );
add_filter( 'shareaholic_disable_recommendations', 'shareaholic_disable_customposts' );`

For all other apps, use ["Targeting Rules"](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us/articles/204887575-How-to-enable-or-disable-Floated-Share-Buttons-from-specific-pages) to disable apps from specific sections of your website.

= How can I change the thumbnail image size for Shareaholic Related Posts? =

The default Shareaholic thumbnail width is 640px with dynamic height and no cropping. The thumbnail size can be specified programmatically by adding `add_image_size('shareaholic-thumbnail', $width, $height, true);` to your theme's `functions.php` file with [appropriate width and height variables](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/).

Each time you change Shareaholic's thumbnail dimensions like this, you will probably want to have WordPress regenerate appropriate sized thumbnails for all of your images. We highly recommend the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin for this purpose.

**Are you missing your Facebook Share Counts?** *Facebook recently decided to drop support for unauthenticated Share Count lookups. Shareaholic offers two options to get back your Facebook Share Counts:*

  * [Self-hosted by you (free option)](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us/articles/202809466-WordPress-Plugin-Share-Count-Proxy-API-Local-)
  * [Cloud Hosted on our servers (premium option)](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029500132-Share-Count-Proxy-API-Hosted-) Recommended
